<p>I am a highly motivated person and enjoy challenging myself to grow and learn through each step of my career so far, I believe being a
part of the Global Relay team would provide the challenge I am looking for in the next steps of my career. In moving to Canada to live
and work, I am searching for new roles and experiences to help me learn and grow in a professional and personal capacity. In
November 2015 I was approved for a Canadian work permit, allowing me to make this move across the world. <br><br>

During my time in Dublin City University, while gaining my degree, I gained an extensive knowledge of all forms of software
engineering. Along with Object Orientated development such as Java and C++, I have also studied relational databases, software
patterns and concurrent programming in C. Outside of University, I have an interest in learning about all types of technologies that are
new to me and have put this curiosity into learning other programming languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby.<br><br>

I have previously worked with Ariba Technologies for a 6 month period last summer. With Ariba, I primarily worked with Java
creating tools to aid and encourage the automation of work within the company. Along with this I gained experience working with Perl
and a relational database for Ariba.<br><br>

Since completing my degree, I have been working in implementations and project management in a financial company. I have been
working in a client facing role, looking after the management and implementation of financial reports for large banks and asset
managers across Europe and the US. In this role I have been using a bespoke solution for the implementation along with SQL, XML
and XSLT. I took this role, as it allowed me to gain knowledge and experience in areas that my degree did not cover. I believe that my
time in my implementations role in the finance industry has given me a breadth of knowledge in project management and the rigors of
being in a client facing role. I believe this work has helped me enhance of the abilities I learned during the study for my degree.</p>
